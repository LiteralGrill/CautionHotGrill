<center><i><h5>(Posted April 13, 2025)</h5></i></center>

<p>Followers of seasonal anime know that spring is always a bountiful time packed with some of the best shows found each year. Spring is also known for how many animals have their mating period during it, including the libidinous species known as Animatio Fanaticus. Fortunately for fervid fans of fanservice and more, the Spring 2025 anime season has more shows than usual to last you through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvrE_ekDXQc">the lusty month of May</a> and beyond. Yes a horny anime fan can reference a broadway musical, deal with it.</p>

<p>Seriously though, there’s a particularly large amount of erotic, ecchi, and hentai titles with episodes releasing weekly this season. As another pleasant surprise, new <a href="https://oceanveil.net/">streaming service OceanVeil</a> is making it so several titles we normally couldn’t view legally in North America are available to watch! When trying to find which ones are worth watching however, you might have run into episode guides from people who generally don’t enjoy these genres, or who won’t cover the more saucy releases at all, making it difficult to choose what’s worth your limited time to seek out.
</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://awc.moe/challenger/LiteralGrill">certified</a> <a href="https://anilist.co/forum/thread/5559/1">hentai master</a>, I have no qualms about the fact that folks sometimes want a little lust alongside their anime and that its weird and often curiously erotic nature is what attracts some to it as a medium. So I’m here to offer a first episode preview covering new shows (if its second season is coming out, you won’t find it here) on the ecchi and erotic side of things. I’ll talk about the turn ons and turn offs of each show and as a bonus share them all in order of which I personally find them least to most interesting. 
</p>
<p>Needless to say there is plenty of adult content ahead, <b>so any readers under 18 please make good choices about what you consume and consider if it is appropriate for you to read ahead.</b> The time for long winded intros is done, let’s get to the anime!

<h3>Yandere Dark Elf: She Chased Me All the Way From Another World!</h3>

<p><i>Hinata did it. He got reincarnated into another world, took up the mantle of Hero, and slew the dreaded Demon Lord alongside his party of fellow adventurers. As his reward, he’s returned to Earth to resume a normal life. Or it would be if it wasn’t for the fact that his dark elf companion Mariabelle decided to travel to Earth to come and live with him! Now she uses her arcane talents to ward off any potential romantic rivals and capture Hinata’s affection.</i> (Seven Seas Entertainment)</p>

<h4>Turn Ons: </h4>
<p>I wouldn’t be the first person to point out we’re in an anime elf renaissance as of late so it makes tons of sense for Yandere Dark Elf to come out now. I’m sure there’s an eager audience that will be watching purely because of the elf in the title, let alone the fact that it’s a yandere one to boot. She’s a busty beautiful elf girl who is absolutely obsessed over the self-insert MC, what’s not to love? The show is absolutely aware of what it is and sets out to deliver on its premise so hey, if you were curious to watch based on the title alone, you won’t be disappointed! Our elf in question is also naked for the majority of the first episode and I know that will be a positive to most if that trend continues across episodes. The animation is also serviceable, which is nice to see considering how rough certain lewder shows can get. </p>
<h4>Turn Offs:</h4>
<p>The obvious age gap and shotacon content are going to make this show an instant no for some people. I know a lot of folks age up characters in their heads since it seems like every other anime takes place in high school, but it’s going to be particularly difficult with the MC being a middle schooler.</p> 

<p>For those that can still look past that or enjoy it, the next biggest issue is that the yandere elf barely feels like a yandere! There are a few moments where she seems a tad overly possessive, and she did hunt down Hinata all the way for another world, but I just guess I think of yanderes as far more murderous and unhinged personally! I’ve heard that the official Japanese title reflects that a bit more accurately, so unfortunately it might just be a localization choice getting in my way here.</p>

<p><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/anime_pics/yanderedarkelfy.gif" align="center" alt="A dark elf looking menacingly holding onto a young boy while naked, her hair swirling around her magically, looking almost as if it's clutching the boy."></p>

<p>I mentioned the serviceable animation, but outside of titty jiggles, don’t expect something too expressive. Even when there is some breasting boobily it falls a bit flat for me, not managing to be exactly titillating. 
</p>

<h4>Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; </h4>

<p>I think why this one is on the bottom for me is just because yandere who is super obsessed with a guy inappropriately in ways just kinda feels played out, even with a fresh new coat of reverse isekai paint. Honestly, you probably knew if you were going to watch this one or not based on the title, and while that straightforwardness is solid for some, it’s just not something I expect to find all too interesting through a full twelve episode series, even if it’s a short form anime. So if it sounds interesting to you, don’t let me yuck your yum, enjoy!</p>

<p><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/anime_pics/Takamine.png" align="center" alt="A girl pointing dramatically at a boy with a nervous sweat drop on his head."></p>
<h3>Please Put Them On, Takamine-san </h3>

<p><i>Takane Takamine is the goddess of her high school. With perfect grades, athletic prowess, and unrivaled beauty, this student council president is the apple of everyone's eye-including Koushi Shirota, a below-average student with no friends or social prospects whatsoever. But he'll soon find out the secret behind Takamine's unbelievable success-her underwear! When she strips, she can undo any of her past actions, and now that Koushi knows, Takamine won't let him off so easy…  
</i> (Yen Press)</p>

<h4>Turn Ons: </h4>
<p>As that one Grill weirdly obsessed with Groundhog Day, a weird time travel concept where someone can change any mistake they make with horny magic does have a certain appeal! The first episode seems to make it clear that what counts as an accident to be fixed could have quite the variety, and that Takamine isn’t afraid of unleashing horrifying consequences to get what she wants.</p> 

<p>Also, I felt like I needed to mention that this show has an odd amount of similarities to Komi Can’t Communicate in a weird way as I’ve seen no one else articulate this online. They obviously won’t be similar experiences to watch, but if folks lusted after the long dark haired perfect “goddess” of the school in that show, Takamine-san might be right up their alley.</p>

<h4>Turn Offs:</h4>
<p>While I praised the premise of the show, it does kinda feel like it really locks in what each story will be about. A mistake happens, panties go missing, our protagonist has to find a creative way to get the panties back on in public without anyone noticing. Our protagonist is horny about this and our alluring lady is also horny about it a bit, but hides it so protag-kun doesn’t find out. If this specific kind of kink scenario is exactly the kind of thing you’re into, that’s fine! Otherwise, it might wear itself out quickly.</p> 

<p>Sometimes, the faces on the show head into uncanny valley territory and <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2025/spring/please-put-them-on-takamine-san/.221948">I’m not the only one who noticed</a>. Every now and then especially, it feels like the mouths of characters just plain are sat in the right position on the face. Honestly, I could see someone missing this if they aren’t looking too closely, but I didn’t become a certified hentai master to not notice details!</p>

<p><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/anime_pics/badjawline.gif" align="center" alt="A gif showing the awkwardly placed mouth on the male MC in the show."></p>

<p>Finally, the fact that our MC is essentially blackmailed into doing all of the panty changing in question on threat of having his life absolutely destroyed by a sexual assault charge is going to reasonably give some people serious ick. That kind of coercion in particular might be rough for folks with certain traumas, and those folks should probably go out of their way to avoid this show.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and everyone in the show is in high school. Yay anime? Again, might be an absolute no for some, but unlikely to stop seasoned anime viewers, especially on the lewder side of the tracks. Also, only the censored version is available for legal streaming as far as I know. If the appeal of the show is the saucy bits for you, I can say this will unfortunately make it even less appealing to watch. Be prepared to see what is almost like a magical girl transformation sequence quite often as well whenevr Takamine uses her powers. It's a creative way to pad out time for an episode with otherwise not as much content and does look interesting, but I have a feeling it'll get old fast.</p>

<h4>Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734; </h4>

<p>In some ways, I wish this was a little more on the ecchi side than horny, because I could see myself laughing my ass off watching someone try to expertly slingshot some panties onto a girl from across a room or something. Still, I’m kind of curious to see where things go. I’ve been able to see episode two as of writing this and see there might even be a chance for actual romance here. Takamine has been alone with this power for so long, with no one else knowing it exists theoretically, perhaps sharing that burden with someone is more special to her than our MC Shirota realizes.</p>

<h3>Unexpectedly Naughty Fukami</h3>

<p><i>"How does someone as perfect as me get turned on by a guy who's so... ordinary?!"

Kaji’s good looks and charm have made him popular with everyone at his office. However, beneath the surface, he secretly looks down on others and judges them by a scoring system! If only he could find the perfect bottom who could live up to his standards. One day, Kaji finds himself on an overnight business trip with his bland colleague, Fukami. Unimpressed by the plain-looking Fukami, Kaji vows that even if they were the last two people on a deserted island, he would never consider sleeping with him!

At least, that’s what he thought... until he glimpsed Fukami coming out of the shower and realized his irresistibly cute and erotic side!

<h4>Turn Ons: </h4>
<p>It’s been one of those weeks, pass the yaoi! We often see ladies put on display for our lecherous anime viewing pleasures so I always gotta appreciate a little bit of eye candy on the more masculine side!</p> 

<p>To my knowledge, this is the first simuldubbed boys love anime ever and that’s honestly awesome! Whenever possible, I like to watch my hentai dubbed as it can either be absolutely hilarious or surprisingly competent and enjoyable. In this case, the dub is rather well done! While there were a couple stilted moments they seemed more because of unfortunate lip flaps that needed to be matched than anything the voice actors had control over.</p>

<p>In general, the concept also seems pretty amusing for future episodes. I like the idea of a guy who thinks way too much of himself being taken down a peg and learning how not to judge books by their covers. Or to at least have more reasonable standards and understand some of the best sex of your life often comes from those who aren’t perfect tens.</p>

<p>Extremely minor spoiler alert, but it’s cool to see a sex scene in any porn, let alone hentai, where someone wears a condom! Especially with the history of keeping safe within the gay community, it’s kind of a nice touch to see here in particular.
</p>
<h4>Turn Offs:</h4>
<p>Let’s just get this out of the way, if you don’t like hot man on man action, you’re not going to like this show. Full stop. With that said…</p> 

<p>These episodes are pretty darn short, so we’re likely not going to get to see much characterization happening in the show. I’ve fallen in love with <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/show-time-mixing-erotica-sex-positivity-and-tv-idols/">short shows like this before</a> from Ascendent Animation to boot, but since there has to be a sex scene every episode, it really does limit potential storytelling. Which sucks to say after just expressing my excitement for its premise.</p>

<p>The animation on this first episode was particularly rough in spots, showing its likely low budget quite a bit. Fukami’s penis seems to go off model several times as well, which is maybe nitpicking, but it’s weird seeing how it looks change so drastically scene to scene. Finally, some of the scenes just look… Unappealing. This may be a personal taste thing, but I found my lady boner going down a little during certain parts of the sex scene. I’ll leave you an example of the cum shot here as an example of what I meant. Maybe I'm just being weird or picky, but the anatomy feels off in ways, like whoever drew it doesn't understand the appeal of the masculine naked form.</p>

<p><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/anime_pics/badcumzshots.gif" align="center" alt="A man kisses another man, and then the scene focuses on him cumming inside the other man's ass."></p>


<h4>Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734; </h4>

<p>I’m rating this one a little higher mostly in hope that the series, premise, and characters end up being as good as they have the potential to be. I had considered ranking it a bit lower, but the superb nature of the dub made as well as Ascendent Animation’s impressive track record made me give it the benefit of the doubt. If your reaction to the gif above was, “Wow Grill, you’re being way too picky, that looks just fine” it’s likely the animation won’t throw you off too badly either. I’m remaining hopeful for this one!</p>

<h4> Streaming On: <a href="https://oceanveil.net/anime_titles/146">OceanVeil</a> (Uncensored!)</h4>

<center><p><img src="/border.png" width="120" height="30" alt=""></p></center>

<p><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/anime_pics/Makina.jpg" align="center" alt="A cute girl with orange, red, and yellow hair winking."></p>
<h3>Kakushite! Makina-san!</h3>

<p><i>This risque romantic comedy story centers on Eita, an introvert mecha otaku high schooler who has a crush on the school's most popular girl Makina. When Eita finds Makina at her doorstep, he is flustered, and even more so when Makina reveals her secret: that she is a "sexaroid" robot designed for pleasure, and she is asking Eita to conduct some repairs on her discreetly. While Makina immediately tries to make a move on Eita physically, Eita struggles to contain himself, while also hiding her secret.  
</i> (Anime News Network)</p>

<h4>Turn Ons: </h4>
<p>This show has the best chance of delivering an actually interesting plot on top of its sex appeal of the entire season by far. The first episode gives us hints that someone working on AI robots who is hiding her identity might be up to something sneaky. Makina, our titular lovebot, being almost assassinated makes you wonder just how sinister that something might be!</p> 

<p>Speaking of, I’ve got to give credit to any show that realizes robot girls can be just as hot with their chassis absolutely destroyed and their limbs literally falling off as they are in perfectly working order. I gasp I gusped at seeing that scene! I wasn’t expecting something so impressive out of my hentai! In general, the production values here aren’t mind blowing but way better than I’m used to seeing in shows with full blown nudity like this. Seriously, this looks better than certain isekai shows out this season and it has its own personality! Impressive!</p>

<p><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/anime_pics/legfalloff.gif" align="center" alt="A panning shot of a naked robot girl with a busted chasis showing her leg falling off her body."></p>

<p>The titular Makina is pretty cute and seems to be a fun little gremlin potentially, but I found myself rather like Eita more than anything. I’m so used to seeing kinda blah male MCs for viewers to self insert with, but Eita at least has a bit more depth. He loves AI and robots, and proves himself to actually be extremely capable at repairing them in the episode, dealing with design specs he didn’t even realize were possible to be created before. </p>

<p>The fact that he potentially hurt himself to save a robot he had designed was the reason Makina first starts to like him is also a nice touch. It’s simple to just let an MC have all the womens because hey, he’s the MC, but I like it when they earn it! I wish these kink based MCs got to have these cute things they’re passionate about and not just be “losers” all the time. If I wanna pretend I’m the MC, why can’t the MC have a few admirable traits too?</p>

<h4>Turn Offs:</h4>
<p>Yet again our main characters are school age, so that’s going to be a no go for some folks. I can’t remember which year they found themselves in while going to school but Eita does look particularly young, once more in shotacon territory, especially compared to Makina. So if that’s going to be a hard no, better skip this one.</p> 

<p>The episodes are once more rather short, but I found a lot more crammed into just episode one than I could expect. It didn’t force a full blown sex scene in expense of making sure the story it told got to happen, which is nice. Heck, I’m almost listing a positive again, aren’t I? To be fair, the show does have a bit of a breakneck pace at times which might be too much for people.</p>

<p>We’ve certainly seen character gets a sex robot, woman who wants to have sex with him, whatever, that he doesn’t want several times before. If the other plot hooks set in episode one don’t end up paying off, this show will lose a lot of its promise quickly. I have also been told that serious robot otaku might be disappointed in some of the translation choices as Eita seems very surprised about certain robotic components that really might not be out of the ordinary.</p>


<h4>Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734; </h4>

<p>I truly think this show has the most potential out of all the horny releases coming out this season with its solid production values and even potentially an interesting plot! There’s nothing wrong with one hand warrior watching without a care for the world, but I really appreciate an underlying plot in my porn personally! It helps me care more about the characters and just makes them entertaining pieces of media even after I had to grab the towel I keep by the bed, ya know? Hopefully, it’ll manage to live up to my expectations!</p>

<h4> Streaming On: <a href="https://oceanveil.net/anime_titles/148">OceanVeil</a> (Uncensored!)</h4>

<center><p><img src="/border.png" width="120" height="30" alt=""></p></center>

<p>Well as the famous crossdressing rabbit usually says, “That’s all folks!” See? I knew I could bring it back to the whole spring thing! While there are a couple other shows on the saucy side coming out much later in the season like <i>Notto Sexaroid Eurie!</i> and <i>Boku no Risou no Isekai Seikatsu</i>, I don’t know if those will even be available via legal means in North America yet. If that changes, or they do become available, I’ll add them to this article upon their release if anything changes. I’m not against people enjoying their rum on the seven seas when they have to, but especially seeing OceanVeil making a bold attempt to provide a service we don’t usually get here in a tough market, I want to lead folks to shows like that more than I do our saltiest sailors at the moment.</p>

<p>Did I miss a show that feels like it really should fall into being a new ecchi, erotic, or hentai releasing this season? Check that side panel and bother me on social media! I’ll give em’ a watch and add them here too.</p>

<p>And hey, if there’s more anime like this when summer shows start coming out? Perhaps I can make these guides a bit of a tradition~ </p>
