<p>While censorship of adult media <a href="https://stop-paypros.neocities.org/">has been on the rise</a>, lewd-leaning anime has seen several boons this year! New streaming service OceanVeil made streaming hentai legally more accessible than ever alongside uncensored anime usually not available anywhere else and we’ve seen more releases this year of seasonal hentai and ecchi than ever before!</p>
              <p>With said aforementioned censorship, it seems more important than ever to celebrate the shows released this year either with sincere praises or good-hearted jabs as needed. While of course there have been some stinkers this year, there really are some shows that I’d suggest every anime fan should check out, even if they don’t usually visit the ecchi side of the train tracks. For those who ain’t got time for all my “clever witticisms” or simply want some recommendations for what to watch and what to avoid, I get it. Scroll to the bottom for a simple bullet point list of the top three worst and best adult anime of the year. For everyone else, let’s start handing out these curiously titled awards!</p>

              <h3>The "For The Very First Time" Award goes to… Unexpectedly Naughty Fukami</h3>
              <p align="center"><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/anime_pics/Unexpectedly Naughty Fukami.png" align="center"></p>

<p><i></i>Unexpectedly Naughty Fukami</i> became the first ever boys love anime to receive an official English simuldub release this year! I was lucky enough to <a href="https://yattatachi.com/marquiz-moor-unexpectedly-naughty-fukami-interview">interview Marquiz Moore</a>, Kaji’s voice actor, earlier this year, and it was immediately obvious how much love went into this dub. That dedication feels especially meaningful in a year when multiple boys’ love releases were delayed or cancelled altogether, compounded by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-05-05/bl-anime-studio-grizzly-dissolves/.224083">Studio Grizzly dissolving</a>. It’s short and sweet, just eight episodes at six minutes a pop, so if you want to fujoshi out over steamy sex scenes in your native English language for once, give it a go!</p>
              
<h3>The Nearly an Hour of Hentai to Sleep To Award goes to… The Share House's Secret Rule</h3>
              <p align="center"><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/2025awards/TheShareHouse.jpg" align="center"></p>

<p>Hentai can make you laugh at how ridiculous it is, even when it’s doing absolutely nothing for your libido. Sometimes, there’s even a genuinely engaging story wedged between the bouncing boobies on screen. <i>The Share House’s Secret Rule</i> is not arousing, not entertaining, and not even memorably bad—just so boring you regret every second you voluntarily spent watching it. I unironically think I could replace the hours long video essays on video games and TV shows I’ve never seen nor played with this and would be able to sleep just as soundly, hence the award!</p> 
<p>It’s so sad too, because the premise of this guy doing chores to get minutes of time to do “whatever he wants” could have been interesting! He could have had to squeeze in curiously kinky scenes in a short period of time, making the girls wish the time went even longer. Instead, he basically gets to just do whatever he wants, including lots of poorly advised, and animated, fucking in public. Which of the two girls that he’s fucking does he want to be with more in the end? What even are their names again? The show was so mind numbing, I legitimately forgot. </p>               
              
    <h3>The Shoulder Blade Penetration “Sex” Scene Award goes to… Hands off: Sawaranaide Kotesashi-kun!</h3>
              <p align="center"><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/2025awards/shouldebladesnusnu.webp" align="center"></p>
<p>Have you wanted a show like <i>Food Wars</i> but <b>even more horny</b> and focused on sports medicine? <i>Hands off: Sawaranaide Kotesashi-kun!</i> got legitimate laughs out of me, not just little snorts or chuckles, actual <i>belly</i> laughs! Any show managing that is cool, but it’s especially neat when there’s some actual massage therapy techniques being shown off at points. Of course, there’s also absolutely bonkers things that no one in sports medicine would ever consider doing, but this isn’t exactly an anime focused on realism now, is it? This is another one with shorter episodes, just twelve minutes a piece, so it’s really easy to watch or try out to see if it’s for you! Besides, how many other anime have shoulder blade penetration themed naughtiness? </p>  
              
      <h3>The Austin Powers Understands Consent Better than You Award goes to… Chuhai Lips: Canned Flavor of Married Women!</h3>
              <p align="center"><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/2025awards/austinpowers.jpg" align="center"></p>
              <p>Step 1: Run into an older woman who is married.</p> 
              <p>Step 2: Drink lots of booze with her. </p> 
              <p>Step 3: <i>*hentai noises*</i></p> 
              <p>Step 4: Profit!!!</p> 
<p>Each episode has the same plot where the most mid guy ever to exist keeps having sex of dubious consent with married women after getting them really drunk. To be fair, it seems many of said women desperately want to cheat on their husbands, but it’s still kinda messed up when you think about it. In general, this one is also so formulaic it becomes boring very quickly and leaves me wishing something a bit more interesting had gotten chosen for adaptation over this one.</p> 
              
              <h3>The Hold Up, Let Them Cook Award goes to… Please Put Them On, Takamine-san</h3>
              <p align="center"><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/anime_pics/Takamine.png" align="center"></p>
<p>Even for a fanservice-forward anime, <i>Please Put Them On, Takamine-san</i> has a hell or a premise. Time travel via underwear removal? A guy forced to be a human closet, putting panties on a girl in public, so she can repeat things whenever she wants? It makes sense that episode one <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2025/spring/please-put-them-on-takamine-san/.221948">put a lot of reviewers off</a> especially as it wasn’t the most gorgeously animated thing ever. An unfortunate fate as this tease-mobile has a lot more under the hood than one might expect.</p> 
<p>It’s easy to say this show is one person with a specific fetish figuring out a way to make a story work around it, but power dynamics and consent are primary themes used here in interesting ways. There’s an intentionally uncomfortable power imbalance between Takamine and Shirota and the show uses that to explore ideas about obligation, agency, and emotional vulnerability alongside its expected sexy slapstick. </p>
<p>This tension in the story is the point and it creates a surprisingly compelling romance for those willing to give it a chance and really dive past its surface level silliness. I’m not saying this is the greatest romance of all time, just that it has more to offer than most might expect. With that in mind, it took me a while to get really drawn in as well—so this would certainly break the three episode rule for a lot of people— making me understand that not everyone may want to give it such a big chance when so many amazing anime came out this year. </p>
              
              <h3>The How Did You Make Beastiality So Bland Award goes to… Beheneko: The Elf-Girl's Cat is Secretly an S-Ranked Monster! </h3>
              <p align="center"><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/2025awards/BehenekoBallzStare.jpg" align="center"></p>
<p>Everyone who has heard of <i>Beheneko</i> knows it as the “cat fucking anime” for a reason. Because, to put it bluntly, loads of girls in the show want to fuck a literal cat. Instead of something unhinged like <i>My Life as Inukai-san’s Dog</i>, we get what is mostly a bog standard isekai story that is exceedingly bland outside of the moments of random attempted cat fucking and nudity tossed in like <i>Subway Surfers</i> footage to help keep audiences focused.</p> 
<p>In all seriousness, folks who tend to like isekai could probably not just get through this series, but might genuinely enjoy themselves so long as they check out the censored version. Just let your eyes roll into the back of your head when getting frisky with the feline comes up.</p>
              
              <h3>The Wait, Is This Covid-Concious Hentai?!? Award goes to… Guilty Hole ～ Room of Guilty Pleasure!</h3>
              <p align="center"><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/2025awards/GuiltyHoleMasked.jpg" align="center"></p>
<p>Alright, this one only makes the list because of the amazingly well done mask wearing blowjob scene. But I literally saw this and had to share it in several covid-concious Discord groups I’m in where it was universally loved. So if you can deal with a story about a teacher getting to magically have sex with his students for being better at his job and are into that, have at it! If not, completely understandable. </p> 

                  <h3>The Will Be Overlooked in Anime of the Year Discussions Award goes to… Nukitashi the Animation</h3>
              <p align="center"><img style="display:block;" width="100%" height="100%" src="/anime_posts/2025awards/NukitashiTheAnimation.webp" align="center"></p>
<p><i>Nukitashi the Animation</i> has some of the most sex shown on screen out of any anime I have ever seen and I’m a <a href="https://awc.moe/challenger/LiteralGrill">certified</a> <a href="https://anilist.co/forum/thread/5559/1">hentai master</a>. When this show aired on TV, some parts had to be audio only because there was no way to reasonably censor it. This will be enough for most people to never watch the show which is a downright shame because it should truly be in consideration for anime of the year.</p> 
<p>The show’s nudity and sexual content aren’t just tossed in for cheap laughs—though the show is a prime example of ecchi comedic perfection—they’re genuinely central to the story being told. I’m far from the first person to call it a reverse <i>Shimoneta</i>, but that comparison really nails the premise. In a society where sex and lewdness aren’t taboo but actively expected, what happens to the people who don’t, or can’t, conform? What if you’re a lesbian expected to sleep with any man who asks? What if you only want sex when love is involved? What if your body makes others treat intimacy with you as something “too strange” to consider?</p>              
<p>Given all the censorship discussed earlier in this article, the conclusion the series arrives at feels remarkably progressive. Without spoiling anything, its core message—that a truly healthy society makes room for both the sexually adventurous and those who aren’t—is exactly the kind of perspective we could use more of right now. Trying to obliterate the accessibility of things that make people uncomfortable, fetish-focused or not, is not the way to go. We need to do better at curating our own experiences and providing the tools to make that easier so everyone can freely express themselves and be their truest selves.</p>
<p>It might not be the anime of the year audiences are clamoring for, but it’s very much the one this moment calls for. The bitter irony is that the same nudity and sexual content that power its message are also what will likely prevent it from being considered. </p>

              <p>While there were a few other titles released this year, they didn’t stand out in a big enough way for me to manage an irreverently titled award for them. For those who truly salivate over salacious shows, you’ll find these last three to be, at worst, watchable: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Marry Me, Let's Have a Baby!</i></li>
  <li><i>Yandere Dark Elf: She Chased Me All the Way From Another World!</i></li>
  <li><i>Kakushite! Makina-san!</i></li>
</ul> 
              <p>Thank you so much for checking out my blog and seeking out the opinions of a wise hentai master with what mature materials you might enjoy! I can only hope we get another incredible slate of adult-oriented shows in 2026. Stay saucy BBQTs~</p>
